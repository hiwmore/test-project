<h4>It Tech for women</h4>
<ul?

    
    
   
    <li>Studying IT programming at Sundsgården Folkhögskola</li>
    <li>The course provides basic skills and knowledge in web development. We work partially in teams of 2-4 participants in each team and partially individually. The course will often be project based where most of the teaching is online. Online teaching will sometimes alternate with guest lectures online as well as two physical meetings at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola. Together we will learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the teams will then be able to deepen their understanding and sharpen their skills within these areas of web development.</li>
